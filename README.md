# 3-Staged-Pipelined-RISC-V-Processor
This repository features a 3-stage pipelined RISC-V processor, designed for efficient instruction execution. Based on the RISC-V ISA, it balances performance and simplicity with Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID) and Execute (EX), and Memory(MEM) and Write Back(WB) stages.
